# maya-tools
These are some tools I've developed in Python for Maya, using PyQt/PySide and Maya API

<a href="https://github.com/tincro/maya-tools/blob/master/ac_browWin.py">ac_browWin.py</a> is an asset browser that is used to search published categories of assets, and can load or import those assets from the desired folder.
Also, assets can be published from this window, allowing ease for publication of the assets to the specified location set in the browser window.
