# maya-tools
These are some tools I've developed in Python for Maya, using PyQt/PySide and Maya API. Here is a quick video demonstrating what they do on a basic level:

<a href="https://github.com/tincro/maya-tools/blob/master/ac_browWin.py">ac_browWin.py</a> is an asset browser that is used to search published categories of assets, and can load or import those assets from the desired folder.
Also, assets can be published from this window, allowing ease for publication of the assets to the specified location set in the browser window.

<a href="https://github.com/tincro/maya-tools/blob/master/ac_scatterCmd.py">ac_scatterCmd.py</a> is custom command using the Maya API. The goal was to try to replicate a similar function to the Copy To Points Node in Houdini. The first geometry in the selection will be copied to all of the vertices of the second geometry in the selection.
